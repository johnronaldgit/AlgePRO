**Learning Objectives**  
#### At the end of the lesson, you will be able to:

#### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. Derive a formula for factoring the difference of two squares.
#### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. Discuss how the difference of two squares is done.
#### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. Factor polynomials completely using the difference of two squares.

#### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Recall the topic about special products, particularly the product of the sum and difference of two terms. It states that the product of $(a + b)$ and $(a - b)$ is equal to the difference of two squares, which is $a^2 - b^2$.

$$
\mathbf{(a + b)(a - b) = a^2 - b^2}
$$

#### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Notice that when the sum and difference of two terms are multiplied (meaning, the first and second terms of the factors are the same but they differ in operation, one is $+$ while the other is $-$), the result will always be the difference of the squares of the two terms (that is, you square the first term, square the second term and the operation between them is $-$). Thus, to factor the difference of two squares, you just have to reverse the pattern:

$$
\mathbf{a^2 - b^2 = (a + b)(a - b)}
$$

#### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In order to use this factoring technique, recall the concept of perfect squares. For example, $16, \ x^2, \ 25a^2, \ 9y^2$, and $\left(\frac{3}{4}\right)^2$. These are all perfect squares. Why? Look at and study the illustration below.

$$
16 = 4 \cdot 4 = (4)^2 \\
x^2 = x \cdot x = (x)^2 \\
25a^2 = 5a \cdot 5a = (5a)^2 \\
9y^2 = 3y \cdot 3y = (3y)^2 \\
\left(\frac{3}{4}\right)^2 = \left(\frac{3}{4}\right) \cdot \left(\frac{3}{4}\right) = \left(\frac{3}{4}\right)^2
$$

#### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You see from the examples that a perfect square is a number or expression which can be written as an exact square of a rational quantity.

#### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let us now see how to factor the difference of two squares by examining the given examples below.

**Example 1:** Write $x^2 - 9$ in completely factored form.

**Solution:**

#### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Step 1: Express the first and the second terms in exponential form with a power of 2.

$$
x^2 = x \cdot x = (x)^2 \\
9 = 3 \cdot 3 = (3)^2
$$

#### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Step 2: Subtract the two terms in exponential form following the pattern $a^2 - b^2$.

$$
(x)^2 - (3)^2
$$

#### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Step 3: Factor completely following the pattern $a^2 - b^2 = (a + b)(a - b)$

$$
(x + 3)(x - 3)
$$

Hence, the complete factored form is $x^2 - 9 = (x)^2 - (3)^2 = (x + 3)(x - 3)$.

**Example 2:** Write $16a^2 - 25b^2$ in completely factored form.

**Solution:**

#### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Step 1: Express the first and the second terms in exponential form with a power of 2.

$$
16a^2 = 4a \cdot 4a = (4a)^2 \\
25b^2 = 5b \cdot 5b = (5b)^2
$$

#### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Step 2: Subtract the two terms in exponential form following the pattern $a^2 - b^2$.

$$
(4a)^2 - (5b)^2
$$

#### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Step 3: Factor completely following the pattern $a^2 - b^2 = (a + b)(a - b)$

$$
(4a + 5b)(4a - 5b)
$$

#### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hence, the complete factored form of $16a^2 - 25b^2$ is $16a^2 - 25b^2 = (4a)^2 - (5b)^2 = (4a + 5b)(4a - 5b)$.

#### **Example 3:** Write $a^2b^2 - 81$ in completely factored form.

**Solution:**

#### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Step 1: Express the first and the second terms in exponential form with a power of 2.

$$
a^2b^2 = ab \cdot ab = (ab)^2 \\
81 = 9 \cdot 9 = (9)^2
$$

#### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Step 2: Subtract the two terms in exponential form following the pattern $a^2 - b^2$.

$$
(ab)^2 - (9)^2
$$

#### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Step 3: Factor completely following the pattern $a^2 - b^2 = (a + b)(a - b)$.

$$
(ab + 9)(ab - 9)
$$

#### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus, the complete factored form of $a^2b^2 - 81$ is $a^2b^2 - 81 = (ab)^2 - (9)^2 = (ab + 9)(ab - 9)$.

#### Based on the examples above, these are the steps in factoring the difference of two squares:

#### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Step 1: Express the first and the second terms in exponential form with a power of 2.  
#### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Step 2: Subtract the two terms in exponential form following the pattern $a^2 - b^2$.  
#### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Step 3: Factor completely following the pattern $a^2 - b^2 = (a + b)(a - b)$.

#### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Note that there are cases where after expressing each term as a power of 2, the resulting numbers or expressions can still be factored further. This is when the results are still perfect squares. Hence, there is a need to inspect thoroughly and ensure that all terms are completely factored.

#### Consider the following examples:

#### **Example 4:** Write $x^4 - 81$ in completely factored form.

#### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; **Solution:**

$$
x^4 - 81 = (x^2)^2 - (9)^2 = (x^2 + 9)(x^2 - 9)
$$

#### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The two factors are $(x^2 + 9)(x^2 - 9)$. Notice the second factor $(x^2 - 9)$ is a difference of two squares, thus, it can still be factored out. That is,

$$
(x^2 - 9) = (x)^2 - (3)^2 = (x + 3)(x - 3)
$$

#### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This means that the complete factored form of $x^4 - 81$ is

$$
x^4 - 81 = (x^2)^2 - (9)^2 = (x^2 + 9)(x^2 - 9) = (x^2 + 9)(x + 3)(x - 3)
$$

#### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the example above, $x^2 + 9$ is called the sum of two squares. It cannot be factored!

#### **Example 5:** Write $3w^2 - 48$ in completely factored form.

**Solution:**

#### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At first glance, it seems like the given binomial is not factorable using the sum and difference of two terms since the terms are not perfect squares. Note, however, that the first and second terms of the binomial have a common factor of 3. Hence, the binomial can be factored using a combination of GCMF and the sum and difference of two terms.

#### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Find the GCF of the terms and write it in factored form.

$$
3w^2 - 48 = 3(w^2 - 16)
$$

#### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Observe that $w^2 - 16$ is a difference of two squares. Hence, it can be factored as

$$
w^2 - 16 = (w)^2 - (4)^2 = (w + 4)(w - 4)
$$

#### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus, the complete factored form of $3w^2 - 48$ is

$$
3w^2 - 48 = 3(w + 4)(w - 4)
$$

#### **SUMMARY**

#### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The factors of the difference of two squares are the product of the sum and difference of the same two terms. In symbol:

$$
\mathbf{x^2 - y^2 = (x + y)(x - y)}
$$
