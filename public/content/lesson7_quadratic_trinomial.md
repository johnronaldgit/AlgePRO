**Learning Objectives**  
#### At the end of the lesson, you will be able to:

#### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. Define a quadratic polynomial.
#### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. Discuss how to factor a quadratic polynomial.
#### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. Find the factors of a quadratic polynomial completely.

#### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A **quadratic polynomial** is a polynomial with a degree of the leading term equal to 2. In this lesson, we prioritize quadratic trinomials which are not perfect square trinomials. Trinomials of this form are written in the form $ax^2 + bx + c$, where $a$ and $b$ are the numerical coefficients of the variables and $c$ is the constant term. Trial and error are being utilized in factoring this type of trinomials.

#### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Here is an example:

#### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; **Example:** Factor $6z^2 - 5z - 6$ through trial and error:

#### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Give all the factors of $6z^2$ and $-6$.

#### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Factors of:

#### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Write all possible factors using the values above and determine the middle term by multiplying the factors.

#### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the given factors, $(3z + 2)(2z - 3)$ gives the sum of $-5z$, thus, making it the factors of the quadratic trinomial $6z^2 - 5z - 36$. How was the inspection used in factoring? What do you think is the disadvantage of using it?

#### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Factoring through inspection is a tedious and long process; thus, knowing another way of factoring quadratic trinomials would be very beneficial in studying this module.

#### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another way of factoring is through grouping or AC method. Closely look at the given steps and compare them with trial and error.

#### **Example 1:** Factor $6z^2 - 5z - 6$.

#### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. Find the product of the leading term and the last term.

$$
6z^2 - 5z - 6 \\
(6z^2)(-6) = -36z^2
$$

#### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. Find the factors of $-36z^2$ whose sum is $-5z$.

$$
-9z + 4z = -5z
$$

#### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. Rewrite the trinomial as a four-term expression by replacing the middle term with the sum of the factors.

$$
6z^2 - 9z + 4z - 6
$$

#### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4. Group terms with common factors.

$$
(6z^2 - 9z) + (4z - 6)
$$

#### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5. Factor the groups using the greatest common monomial factor.

$$
3z(2z - 3) + 2(2z - 3)
$$

#### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 6. Factor out the common binomial factor and write the remaining factor as a sum or difference of the common monomial factors.

$$
(2z - 3)(3z + 2)
$$

#### **Example 2:** Factor $2k^2 - 11k + 12$.

#### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. Multiply the first and last terms.

$$
(2k^2)(12) = 24k^2
$$

#### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  2. Find the factors of $24k^2$ whose sum is $-11k$.

$$
(-3k) + (-8k) = -11k
$$

#### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. Rewrite the trinomial as four-term expressions by replacing the middle term with the sum factor.

$$
2k^2 - 3k - 8k + 12
$$

#### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4. Group the terms with a common factor.

$$
(2k^2 - 8k) + (-3k + 12)
$$

#### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5. Factor the groups using the greatest common monomial factor.

$$
2k(k - 4) - 3(k - 4)
$$

#### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 6. Factor out the common binomial and write the remaining factor as the sum or difference of the binomial.

$$
(k - 4)(2k - 3)
$$
