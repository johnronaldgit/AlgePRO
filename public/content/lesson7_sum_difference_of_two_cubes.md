**Learning Objectives**  
#### At the end of the lesson, you will be able to:

#### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. Derive a pattern in finding the factors on the sum or difference of two cubes.
#### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. Discuss how to factor binomials which are both perfect cubes.
#### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. Factor completely using the sum or difference of two cubes.

#### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Binomials with both terms perfect cubes can be factored completely by working on the cube root of both terms. The sum or difference of the extracted cube roots is the binomial factor, while the sum of the squares of both terms plus the product of the extracted cube roots is the other factor. In short, binomials with both terms perfect cubes have binomial and trinomial factors. Let us consider the following examples below.

#### **Example 1:** Find the factor of $8x^3 + 27$.

**Solution:**

#### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To find the binomial factor, extract the cube root of both terms. $\sqrt[3]{8x^3} + \sqrt[3]{27} = 2x + 3$. $(2x + 3)$ is the binomial factor. To obtain the other factor, square both terms of the binomial factor, $(2x)^2$, $(3)^2$, and combine the result with the product of both terms of the binomial factor times -1. So, we arrive at the trinomial factor, $(4x^2 - 6x + 9)$. Thus, the factors of $8x^3 + 27$ are $(2x + 3)$ and $(4x^2 - 6x + 9)$.

#### **Example 2:** Find the factor of $64x^3 - 343$.

**Solution:**

#### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To find the binomial factor, extract the cube root of both terms. $\sqrt[3]{64x^3} - \sqrt[3]{343} = 4x - 7$. $(4x - 7)$ is the binomial factor. To obtain the other factor, square both terms of the binomial factor, $(4x)^2$, $(7)^2$, and combine the result with the product of both terms of the binomial factor times -1. So, we arrive at the trinomial factor, $(16x^2 + 28x + 49)$. Thus, the factors of $64x^3 - 343$ are $(4x - 7)$ and $(16x^2 + 28x + 49)$.

#### **SUMMARY**

#### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - The factors of the sum of two perfect cubes are denoted by the formula:

$$
\mathbf{x^3 + y^3 = (x + y)(x^2 - xy + y^2)}
$$

#### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - The factors of the difference of two perfect cubes are denoted by the formula:

$$
\mathbf{x^3 - y^3 = (x - y)(x^2 + xy + y^2)}
$$
