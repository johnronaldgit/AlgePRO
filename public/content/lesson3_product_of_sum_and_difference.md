**Learning Objectives:**  
At the end of the lesson, you will be able to:

#### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. Derive a formula on the product of a sum and the difference of the same two terms.
#### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. Discuss how to find the product of a sum and the difference of the same two terms.
#### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. Find the product of polynomials using the product of a sum and the difference of the same two terms.

To find the product of the sum and difference of the same two terms, use the formula:

$$
\mathbf{(x + y)(x - y) = x^2 - y^2}
$$

**Steps:**

#### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. Distribute the first term of the first binomial to both terms of the second binomial.
#### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. Distribute the second term of the first binomial to both terms of the second binomial.
#### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. Combine like terms and simplify.

#### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; **Example 1:** $(y + z)(y - z)$  
$$
\mathbf{(y + z)(y - z) = y^2 - z^2}
$$

#### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; **Example 2:** $(a - b)(a + b)$  
$$
\mathbf{(a - b)(a + b) = a^2 - b^2}
$$

#### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; **Example 3:** $(m + 3)(m - 3)$  
$$
\mathbf{(m + 3)(m - 3) = m^2 - 9}
$$

#### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; **Example 4:** $(w - 5)(w + 5)$  
$$
\mathbf{(w - 5)(w + 5) = w^2 - 25}
$$

#### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; **Example 5:** $(2x - 5)(2x + 5)$  
$$
\mathbf{(2x - 5)(2x + 5) = 4x^2 - 25}
$$

The product of the sum and difference of the same two terms is the difference between the squares of the two terms.


#### **SUMMARY**

The product of the sum and difference of the same two terms is denoted by:

$$
\mathbf{(x + y)(x - y) = x^2 - y^2}
$$

where $x$ and $y$ are the first and second terms, respectively.
