**Learning Objectives**  
At the end of the lesson, you will be able to:

#### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. Identify polynomials which are special products through pattern recognition.
#### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. Find special products of certain polynomials.
#### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. Apply special products in solving geometric problems.
#### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4. Solve problems involving polynomials and their products.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; **Special products** are specific patterns in algebraic multiplication that simplify the process of expanding polynomials. Recognizing these patterns allows for quicker and more efficient calculations.
 
The following special products come from multiplying out the brackets. You'll need these often, so it's worth knowing them well.

$$
\mathbf{a(x + y) = ax + ay} \quad \text{(Distributive Law)}
$$

$$
\mathbf{(x + y)(x - y) = x^2 - y^2} \quad \text{(Difference of Two Squares)}
$$

$$
\mathbf{(x + y)^2 = x^2 + 2xy + y^2} \quad \text{(Square of a Sum)}
$$

$$
\mathbf{(x - y)^2 = x^2 - 2xy + y^2} \quad \text{(Square of a Difference)}
$$

**Example 1:** Multiply $2x(a - 3)$  
$$
\mathbf{2x(a - 3) = 2ax - 6x}
$$

**Example 2:** Multiply $(7s + 2t)(7s - 2t)$  
$$
\mathbf{(7s + 2t)(7s - 2t) = (7s)^2 - (2t)^2 = 49s^2 - 4t^2}
$$

**Example 3:** Multiply $(3x + 10y)^2$  
$$
\mathbf{(3x + 10y)^2 = (3x)^2 + 2(3x)(10y) + (10y)^2 = 9x^2 + 60xy + 100y^2}
$$

**Example 4:** Multiply $(3p - 4q)^2$  
$$
\mathbf{(3p - 4q)^2 = (3p)^2 - 2(3p)(4q) + (4q)^2 = 9p^2 - 24pq + 16q^2}
$$
