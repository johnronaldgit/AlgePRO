**Learning Objectives**  
At the end of the lesson, you will be able to:

#### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. Derive a formula on the product of binomial and trinomial (special case).
#### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. Discuss how the product of binomial and trinomial (special case) is obtained.
#### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. Find the product of polynomials using the special case on the product of binomial and trinomial.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the sum of two terms is multiplied by the sum of their squares plus the product of these terms, the result is the sum of their cubes.  
#### In symbol:

$$
\mathbf{(x + y)(x^2 - xy + y^2) = x^3 + y^3}
$$

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Similarly, when the difference of two terms is multiplied by the sum of their squares minus the product of these terms, the result is the difference of their cubes.  
#### In symbol:

$$
\mathbf{(x - y)(x^2 + xy + y^2) = x^3 - y^3}
$$

#### **Examples:** Find the product of each pair of binomial and trinomial.

#### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. $(x + 1)(x^2 - x + 1)$
#### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. $(5x - 3)(25x^2 + 15x + 9)$
#### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. $(7a + 1)(49a^2 - 7a + 1)$

#### **Solutions:** Substitute the given in the formula.

#### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. $(x + 1)(x^2 - x + 1) = x^3 + 1$
#### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. $(5x - 3)(25x^2 + 15x + 9) = 125x^3 - 27$
#### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. $(7a + 1)(49a^2 - 7a + 1) = 343a^3 + 1$

#### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the above examples, the product between the sum/difference of two terms and the sum of their squares plus/minus the product of the given two terms is the sum/difference of their cubes.

#### **SUMMARY**

#### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - When the sum of two terms is multiplied by the sum of their squares plus the product of these terms, the result is the sum of their cubes. In symbol:  
$$
\mathbf{(x + y)(x^2 - xy + y^2) = x^3 + y^3}
$$

#### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Similarly, when the difference of two terms is multiplied by the sum of their squares minus the product of these terms, the result is the difference of their cubes. In symbol:  
$$
\mathbf{(x - y)(x^2 + xy + y^2) = x^3 - y^3}
$$
